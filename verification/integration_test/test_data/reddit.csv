I'm trying to use the API(3.5) to create a quiz question generator. However there are some issues that I haven't been able to solve. I'm asking to output the data in json so I can parse it in my application but in doing so the AI seems to be crippled in their ability to generate interesting questions.


This is my initial prompt which includes an example:

    You are to generate quiz questions based on JSON input. Before deciding on a question, try to answer the question yourself, to make sure there are no errors in the generated question.
    Avoid questions about current facts or events.

    {""Category"":""History"",""Difficulty"":""Medium"",""Type"":""Multiple Choice"",""Options"":""4""}


    {""Question"":""When did the second World War start?"",""Option_A"":""1920"",""Option_B"":""1745"",""Option_C"":""1987"",""Option_D"":""1939"",""Answer"":""4""}


My biggest obstacle is that the AI sometimes produces a question with an answer that is arguable or plain wrong. Is there any way I can do a better fact check on the output? It seems to ignore my request of trying to answer the question themselves.

There is also a lack in originality. For example when prompting for a food related question I only get variants of ""What is the main ingredient of X"" which it sometimes gets wrong. I got the question ""what is the main ingredient of Ceasar salad?"" and it said the answer was anchovies. Asking the question to CGPT itself in a separate playground instance and it give the answer Romain Lettuce.

Asking political related questions I only get variations of ""who is the current X in country X""

The next logical step would be to try fine tuning the model but I feel like I can push the model like this a bit more if I use better prompts. What do you all think? I also feel like I should be able to use a cheaper model instead of davinci text 3.",b32ba02eb98f1bb490369d67e4ecdc34fb823d629d5aaf8e2852ec0d175ecbdc,Post,1970-01-01 00:00:01,0.0,0.0

Savez-vous pourquoi?

C‚Äôest parce que la principale raison pour laquelle la FIFA a annul√© les droits de l'Indon√©sie √† accueillir le tournoi...est [l'objection de l'Indon√©sie √† la pr√©sence de l'√©quipe de football isra√©lienne qui s'est qualifi√©e pour participer √† la comp√©tition](https://reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/125r1rj/).

Les sentiments antis√©mites en Indon√©sie sont tr√®s forts et je suis heureux que le gouvernement indon√©sien ait d√©pens√© beaucoup de thune et pass√© tant de mois √† construire toutes ces nouvelles infrastructures pour absolument rien.

Je voudrais clarifier un point ‚Äî je ne suis pas un fan du gouvernement isra√©lien. Cependant, je n'ai aucun probl√®me avec le peuple isra√©lien lui-m√™me.

Je n'ai jamais compris comment ces fanatiques religieux en Indon√©sie ont pu rejeter la pr√©sence d'athl√®tes isra√©liens qui ne voudraient √™tre l√† que pour jouer au football (au lieu de parler de politique).",e7c5d641df5d23555a76a19c94f216f2825eae3f375c1af5fcf3717aa12951eb,Post,1970-01-01 00:00:01,1.0,0.0

I'm in college. I'm wondering if it's normal for them to only hang out with each other and do everything together. I mean, everything. From grocery shopping to eating to sleeping. I can't help but feel left out and never prioritized. I don't want to always be the one initiating plans, and I don't know how to bring it up that I miss hanging out with them. They only want to do things if both of them are down. If one backs out, the other's likely to back out too. One of my closest friends, the glue of our friend group, never comes to hang out with the rest of us anymore.

I feel wrong to say this, but I can't help but feel upset about their relationships, as much as I want them to be happy. I'm single and probably bitter. I feel as though them hanging out with their partner and then not getting alone time, will drain their energy, which makes them not want to hang out with me and my other friends.

Our friend group dynamic has changed so much in the last year. Of course I want the best for my friends, but I feel left out and tired. I don't know what to do. Please help as this is my first time having these issues with friends :(",5f377b21591a013521bf16895def6fa3d6689da11151204305e050e3a77f6465,Post,1970-01-01 00:00:01,3.0,0.0
