"""Advanced scoring example

This example demonstrates:
 - how to use Celery to run multiple scoring task types in parallel
 - how to gracefully handle failures and return partial results
 - fine-grained control over task execution time limits
 - how to include timing information in the results for profiling

Given the flexibility of Celery and Python, there are multiple valid ways to
achieve the above goals. This example is one of many possible implementations.

It is not intended to be prescriptive, and indeed more elegant solutions may
be appropriate for your specific use case.

Note in particular that we make no attempts to use Pydantic models that we
defined in the `tasks.py` module, instead defining separate wrapper dataclasses.
This is the middle ground between the "everything is a dict" approach and the
"everything is a Pydantic model" (leaning on type-based dispatch and validation) approach.
Feel free to use any of these approaches in your own code based on your taste and judgement.

        list[ScoringOutput]: The list of scoring results.

    This function orchestrates the execution of multiple scoring tasks in parallel,
    by sending them to Celery and collecting the results. It attempts to minimize overhead,
    gracefully propagate failures and timeouts, and return a partial result set if necessary.

    The following flow is implemented:
    1. Create a list of tasks from the input data, using the supplied scorer_type label
       and the associated `tasks.py` runner defined in the ScorerType enum.
    2. Send the task group to Celery for execution; this minimizes the overhead of task creation.
       - a list of pending tasks is maintained, keyed by task_id
    3. Busy-wait for the results, updating the output list as they arrive. This approach is
       required due to the limitations of Celery's `get` method, which has seconds-level granularity.
    4. If the deadline is reached, return a partial result set; here we also use the pending list to
       explicitly mark the tasks that did not complete in time.

    Timing information is collected for each task both by this driver function and by the tasks
    themselves. We found it useful to include this information in the output for tuning and profiling.
