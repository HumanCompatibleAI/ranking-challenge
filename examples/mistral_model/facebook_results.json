The greatest trick Donald Trump ever pulled was convincing millions of people that one of the most incompetent individuals on Earth was more intelligent than some of the smartest people alive today. You really can't make this stuff up. Donald Trump is our nation's top national security threat--period! He is incompetent and every day he is in office he is making those who voted for him look more and more foolish. Normally I don't like to say \\\"I told you so,\\\" but I have zero issues saying that now. In all my years following politics I've never seen anything as embarrassing as this. I wasn't a fan of George W. Bush, but even on his worst day I never felt this ashamed of who was in charge of our country. Trump is the punchline to a joke the rest of the world is using to laugh at this country. Donald Trump's advantage is his supporters never hold him accountable, never ask for proof of anything he says (claims he has the \\\"stamina\\\" to be POTUS\\\" yet got \\\"exhausted\\\" in his first foreign trip), make excuses for promises he's already admitted were lies (promised not to touch Medicaid and Social Security), and they attack any facts that debunk his propaganda. Honestly, I'll be surprised if Donald Trump's still in office by the end of summer. This is a desperate man who seems to be grasping at straws to save his own backside. I won't be shocked if he gets up and resigns citing the inability to \\\"Make America Great Again\\\" because everyone's out to get him. Because that's what Trump always does when he fails -- blames everyone else. When Donald Trump proves he's not a traitor or not incompetent and shows his tax returns (audit my ass)and resigns or get impeached, then I'll call him president. Until then, this nation doesn't have one. Donald Trump's our version of Kim Jong Un: An insecure dictator with a ridiculous hair cut who pushes absurd propaganda to make himself look better!! I'm sorry, but you have to be an idiot to support Donald Trump. What we learned from James Comey was that someone with a lengthy career working for the judicial system/law enforcement met Trump -- once -- and immediately knew he was a liar who couldn't be trusted. Republicans believe the lies about Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats  while denying the truth about Donald Trump.\"\n    }\n]\n```",

At that time the Party was united, there was no split, but group-division existed, i. e., in the united Party there were virtually two groups, two virtually separate organisations. The local workers\u2019 organisations were united, but on every important issue the two groups devised two sets of tactics. The advocates of the respective tactics disputed among themselves in the united workers\u2019 organisations (as was the case, for example, during the discussion of the slogan: a Duma, or Cadet, Ministry, in 1906, or during the elections of delegates to the London Congress in 1907), and questions were decided by a majority vote. One group was defeated at the Stockholm Unity Congress (1906), the other was defeated at the London Unity Congress (1907).
