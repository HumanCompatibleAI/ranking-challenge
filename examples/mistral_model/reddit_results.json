I had no idea it was deved by the God Eater guys (Shift) or that it served as a prequel or reboot until I started playing. I wish I had, I would have played this little gem of a game a lot sooner.\\n\\nThe parallels are pretty heavy. Io is a lot like Shio, but a bit older and several times bustier. Shio was a young, white-haired, simple spoken savior who learns what it means to be human and then kinda/sorta sacrifices herself for the good of all in the first God Eater game (she's alive, but, stuck on the moon.)\\n\\nLouis is very reminiscent of Rindou/Lindow of God Eater and both have a plot-critical sister. And wouldn't you know it, they have the same last name (Amamiya.)\\n\\nThe monsters of God Eater, Aragami, respawn in a similar manner to the Lost. When killed, both dissipate but later recollect into a baddie. Though it's worth noting that Arigami can also eat each other and assimilate the eaten's cells.\\n\\nThe Drain mechanic is similar to Devour, you steal power from the monsters. And this works because you're kinda-sorta the same thing.\\n\\nBiological compatibility is the ultimate key to super power in both games, and it may also turn you into the very thing you fight.\\n\\nBut the big question is, is Code Vein a reboot? Or a prequel? Loading screens say there's some 4 generations of Revenants. But Rindou Amamiya of God Eater would be part of the first generation born following the collapse. He fights along side, and is presumably of a similar age, to a character named Soma, a child born to researchers studying Oracle Cells just before the Oracle Cells caused the Great Collapse. Those researchers conceived Soma not long after the collapse. Louis would have to be a cousin to Rindou for the timeline to work, or have conceived Rindou pre-revenancy and then the pregnant mom went off to somewhere else besides Code Vein's city.\\n\\nEither way, I'm hoping the Oracle Cell lore from God Eater is retained, at least. I'd very much like to see a battle of the BOR Parasite versus the Oracle Cells, along with Revenants and God Eater fighting side by side, or even a Revenant turned God Eater. Though the camera is going to need some retooling if we're going to be fighting monsters as large as boss Aragami as Revenants.

The strategic problem was that France had less than half the population of Germany in the run up to WW2, so if they were fighting as two armies of maneuver the Germans would always have the personnel advantage. The Maginot line was thus designed to allow the German border to be defended with far less troops than it would take Germany to assault it, to give more parity if Germany invaded in the North. Much like WW1, making Germany invade through Belgium and Holland had political considerations- if Germany only attacked France in a theoretical conflict, then the rest of the world could decide it was just a border conflict and let Germany and France fight it out alone, especially given post WW1 war weariness. But if Germany attacked Belgium, Holland, AND France, safe bet other countries would also join in. The Maginot line didn\u2019t fail France, the positioning of the army did. In the lead up to the German invasion, France had been getting more confident in its ability to repulse a German attack through Belgium. They started shifting more and more troops North into Holland to protect their Allies that would get proper fucked even if Germany was stopped short of France. The French, (and the rest of the world) felt like France\u2019s military equipment was far superior to Germany\u2019s and they felt good about how their armor would perform against Germany\u2019s. Their tanks on paper were probably the best in the world at the time- well armored with good firepower. However, they were hampered by not having radios and most tanks having a 1 man turret- 1 person to locate targets, load the gun, aim and fire, vs 3 man turrets on the Panzer 3 (commander, gunner, loader). This meant when the best German tanks met the best French tanks, the Germans could spot, load, shoot, and inform the rest of their unit what they were shooting at much more efficiently. But the fatal flaw was French armor was slower, and so when they were out of position with most of the army too far North, they couldn\u2019t reposition fast enough to actually get back down to the fight in the Ardennes. In cases where French armor was actually in front of the German advance, the French tanks performed very well. France\u2019s Char B heavy tanks basically couldn\u2019t be touched by German tanks, they were lost when they were bombed, shot out their ammo, ran out of fuel, or when they were unlucky enough to blunder in front of the few 88mm anti-aircraft guns Rommel started aiming at them after watching them shrug off dozens of hits from his tanks and anti-tank guns. Similar thing happened with Russia and the KV1 the following year. So, I realize this is TL:DR, but the Maginot Line did EXACTLY what it was supposed to do and one of the few parts of the French strategy that worked just as intended.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"item_idx\": 6,\n        \"score\": 0.70,\n        \"sentiment\": \"neutral\",\n        \"text\": \"Dolphin rodeo?\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"item_idx\": 1,\n        \"score\": 0.60,\n        \"sentiment\": \"neutral\",\n        \"text\": \"If you are on iOS, I think the issue is the Orbi app doesn\u2019t play well with the iOS settings Private IP Address and Limit IP Address Tracking.

So here are some tips to increase BM production:\\n\\n1. In the last month of pregnancy, start having warm jeera water once a day and after delivery have a teacup of jeera water twice or thrice a day.\\n\\n2. After delivery, Have warm ajwain water 1-2 times a day\\n\\n3. Eat home made panjiri ladoos or you can buy them from Amazon.\\n\\nhttps://amzn.to/42V2YKN\\n\\n4. If still you are struggling with the milk production then you can eat shatavari tablets of Himalaya\\n\\nhttps://www.amazon.in/dp/B003RK877I/ref=cm_sw_r_as_gl_api_gl_i_5AX8T987TM2NX6XYX1RS?linkCode=ml2&tag=myownbuys-21\\n\\n5. Most importantly, the milk production increases when you are happy. When you are happy, a hormone called oxytocin is released in the body which elevates the production. So try not to take any stress be it regarding family or parenting or professional because nothing can replace ur baby.\\n\\n6. Avoid using Mobile phones when ur baby is having ur BM. This restriction to phone is because of 2 reasons: a) the harmful mobile signal will affect the baby\u2019s brain and b) Feel the feeling of ur baby suckling while he/she is drinking milk. Trust me it\u2019s a stress-buster. It\u2019s the best feeling ever.
